# Wallabag GTK client

TODO: this is still in idea phase.


## About

The plan is to build a GUI client with GTK (since there are good Rust
libraries to work with GTK). This would be part of finally getting around to
learning how to program GUI applications properly. It would use the same
backend as the other clients in this project.
